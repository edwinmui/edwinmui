### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### Hello! I'm Edwin. I am currently a software engineer at Credera, where I get to solve exciting problems every day. I have a firm interest in leveraging the power of computers to build solutions that aren't possible otherwise. I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2022 where I studied Information Science, Computer Science, and Business. 

#### Create value, work with amazing people, and be the best. My mission is to always leave things better than how I found them.

#### When I'm not working, I like to work on side projects. I am a big fragrance collector, and am currently working on a fragrance exchange startup. I also like to DJ, with EDM being my favorite genre. You can catch me DJ'ing for my friends at our next hangout.

#### Anyway, I love meeting new people and would love to meet and get to know you. Please reach out if you'd like to have an interesting chat -- Cheers!
